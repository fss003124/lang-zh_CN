An Unraid array consists of one or two Parity disks and a number of Data disks. The Data
disks are exclusively used to store user data, and the Parity disk(s) provides the redundancy necessary
to recover from disk failures.

Since data is not striped across the array, the Parity disk(s) must be as large, or larger than the largest Data
disk.  Parity should also be your highest performance drive.

Each Data disk has its own file system and can be exported as a
separate share.

**Pool Devices** is a single device, or pool of multiple devices, *outside* the Unraid array.  It may be exported for network access just
like an Array device.  Being outside the Unraid array results in significantly faster write access.

There are two ways to configure the Pool devices:

1. As a single device, or
2. As a multi-device pool.

When configured as a single device you may format the device using any supported file system (btrfs, reiserfs,
or xfs).  This configuration offers the highest performance, but at the cost of no data protection - if the
single pool device fails all data contained on it may be lost.

When configured as a multi-device pool, Unraid OS will automatically select *btrfs-raid1* format (for both data
and meta-data).  btrfs permits any number of devices to be added to the pool and each copy of data is guaranteed
to be written to two different devices.  Hence the pool can withstand a single-disk failure without losing data.

When [User Shares](/Settings/ShareSettings) are enabled, user shares may be configured to
automatically make use of the Pool device in order to
speed up writes.  A special background process called the *mover* can be scheduled to run
periodically to move user share files off the Cache and onto the Array.

#### Assigning Devices

An unRAID disk array consists of a single parity disk and a number of data disks. The data
disks are exclusively used to store user data, and the parity disk provides the redundancy necessary
to recover from any singe disk failure.

Note that we are careful to use the term *disk* when referring to an array storage device.  We
use the term *hard drive* (or sometimes just *drive*) when referring to an actual hard disk drive (HDD)
device. This is because in a RAID system it is possible to read/write an array disk whose corresponding
hard drive is disabled or even missing! In addition, it is useful to be able to ask, "which device is
assigned to be the parity disk?"; or, "which device corresponds to disk2?".

We therefore need a way to assign hard drives to array disks. This is accomplished here on the
Main page when the array is stopped. There is a drop-down box for each array disk which lists all the
unassigned devices. To assign a device simply select it from the list. Each time a device
assignment is made, the system updates a configuration file to record the assignment.

#### Requirements

Unlike traditional RAID systems which stripe data across all the array devices, an unRAID server
stores files on individual hard drives. Consequently, all file write operations will involve both the
data disk the file is being written to, and the parity disk. For these reasons,

* the parity disk size must be as large or larger than any of the data disks,

and

* given a choice, the parity disk should be the fastest disk in your collection.

#### Guidelines

Here are the steps you should follow when designing your unRAID disk array:

1. Decide which hard drive you will use for parity, and which hard drives you will use for
data disk1, disk2, etc., and label them in some fashion. Also, find the serial number of each hard
drive and jot it down somewhere; you will need this information later.

2. Install your hard drive devices, boot unRAID Server and bring up the webGui. If this is a fresh system
build, then the Main page will show no disks installed. This doesn't mean the system can't detect your
hard drives; it just means that none have been assigned yet.

3. Remember the serial numbers you recored back in step 1? For parity and each data disk, select the
proper hard drive based on its serial number from the drop down list.

#### Hot Plug

You may also *hot plug* hard drives into your server if your hardware supports it. For example,
if you are using hard drive cages, you may simply plug them into your server while powered on and
with array Stopped. Refresh the Main page to have new unassigned devices appear in the assignment
dropdown lists.

#### Next Steps

Once you have assigned all of your hard drives, refer to the Array Status section below
and Start the array.
:end

:encryption_help:
#### Encryption input

With array Stopped, the user can specify a new encryption key. Note that once a device
is formatted with a particular key it may only be opened using that same key. Changing the encryption key requires
encrypted devices to be reformatted **resulting in permanent loss of all existing data on those devices.**

#### Passphrase

Enter a passphrase of up to 512 characters. It is highly advisable to only use the 95 printable characters from the
first 128 characters of the [ASCII table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), as they will always have the same binary
representation. Other characters may have different encoding depending on system configuration and your passphrase will
not work with a different encoding. If you want a longer passphrase or to include binary data, upload a keyfile instead.

Please refer to the [cryptsetup FAQ](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#5-security-aspects)
for what constitutes a *secure* passphrase.

**Memorize** this passphrase. **IF LOST, ENCRYPTED CONTENT CANNOT BE RECOVERED!**

#### Keyfile

Select a local keyfile with a stored encryption key or a binary file. The maximum size of the keyfile is 8M (8388608 byte).

**Backup** your local keyfile. **IF LOST, ENCRYPTED CONTENT CANNOT BE RECOVERED!**

:info_btrfs_balance_help:
**Balance** will run the *btrfs balance* program to restripe the extents across all pool devices, for example,
to convert the pool from raid1 to raid0 or vice-versa.

When a *full balance* is perfomred, it basically rewrites everything in the current filesystem.

A *mode conversion* affects the btrfs data extents; metadata always uses raid1 and is converted to raid1 if necessary by any balance operation.

The run time is potentially very long, depending on the filesystem size and speed of the device.

Unraid uses these default options when creating a multiple-device pool:

`-dconvert=raid1 -mconvert=raid1`

For more complete documentation, please refer to the btrfs-balance [Manpage](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Manpage/btrfs-balance)

has free space above the current *high water mark*, divide the *high water mark* by 2 and choose again.

The goal of **High-water** is to write as much data as possible to each disk (in order to minimize
how often disks need to be spun up), while at the same time, try to keep the same amount of free space on
each disk (in order to distribute data evenly across the array).

**Fill-up**

:share_edit_split_level_help:
Determines whether a directory is allowed to expand onto multiple disks.

**Automatically split any directory as required**
When a new file or subdirectory needs to be created in a share, Unraid OS first chooses which disk
it should be created on, according to the configured *Allocation method*.  If the parent directory containing
the new file or or subdirectory does not exist on this disk, then Unraid OS will first create all necessary
parent directories, and then create the new file or subdirectory.

**Automatically split only the top level directory as required**
When a new file or subdirectory is being created in the first level subdirectory of a share, if that first
level subdirectory does not exist on the disk being written, then the subdirectory will be created first.
If a new file or subdirectory is being created in the second or lower level subdirectory of a share, the new
file or subdirectory is created on the same disk as the new file or subdirectory's parent directory.

**Automatically split only the top "N" level directories as required**
Similar to previous: when a new file or subdirectory is being created, if the parent directory is at level "N",
and does not exist on the chosen disk, Unraid OS will first create all necessary parent directories.  If the
parent directory of the new file or subdirectory is beyond level "N", then the new file or subdirectory is
created on the same disk where the parent directory exists.

**Manual: do not automatically split directories**
When a new file or subdirectory needs to be created in a share, Unraid OS will only consider disks where the
parent directory already exists.

This setting also affects *mover* behavior.

**No** prohibits new files and subdirectories from being written onto the Cache disk/pool.
*Mover* will take no action so any existing files for this share that are on the cache are left there.

**Yes** indicates that all new files and subdirectories should be written to the Cache disk/pool, provided
enough free space exists on the Cache disk/pool.
If there is insufficient space on the Cache disk/pool, then new files and directories are created on the array.
When the *mover* is invoked, files and subdirectories are transferred off the Cache disk/pool and onto the array.

**Only** indicates that all new files and subdirectories must be writen to the Cache disk/pool.
If there is insufficient free space on the Cache disk/pool, *create* operations will fail with *out of space* status.
*Mover* will take no action so any existing files for this share that are on the array are left there.

**Prefer** indicates that all new files and subdirectories should be written to the Cache disk/pool, provided
enough free space exists on the Cache disk/pool.
If there is insufficient space on the Cache disk/pool, then new files and directories are created on the array.
When the *mover* is invoked, files and subdirectories are transferred off the array and onto the Cache disk/pool.

:smb_case_sensitive_names_help:
Controls whether filenames are case-sensitive.

The default setting of **auto** allows clients that support case sensitive filenames (Linux CIFSVFS)
to tell the Samba server on a per-packet basis that they wish to access the file system in a case-sensitive manner (to support UNIX
case sensitive semantics). No Windows system supports case-sensitive filenames so setting this option to **auto** is the same as
setting it to No for them; however, the case of filenames passed by a Windows client will be preserved.  This setting can result
in reduced peformance with very large directories because Samba must do a filename search and match on passed names.

A setting of **Yes** means that files are created with the case that the client passes, and only accessible using this same case.
This will speed very large directory access, but some Windows applications may not function properly with this setting.  For
example, if "MyFile" is created but a Windows app attempts to open "MYFILE" (which is permitted in Windows), it will not be found.

A value of **Forced lower** is special: the case of all incoming client filenames, not just new filenames, will be set to lower-case.
In other words, no matter what mixed case name is created on the Windows side, it will be stored and accessed in all lower-case.  This
ensures all Windows apps will properly find any file regardless of case, but case will not be preserved in folder listings.
Note this setting should only be configured for new shares.

:cpu_pinning_help:
This page gives a total view of the current CPU pinning assignments for Docker containers.<br>
It also allows to modify these assignments.

Running containers are **stopped first** and restarted after the modification.<br>
Stopped containers are instantly modified and new assignments become active when the user manually starts the container.

When ***Apply*** is pressed a scan is performed to find the changes, subsequently containers which have changes are modified in parallel.

*Important: Please wait until all updates are finished before leaving this page*.

By default NO cores are selected for a Docker container, which means it uses all available cores.<br>
Do not select **ALL** cores for containers, just select **NO** cores if you want unrestricted core use.

Do not select cores for containers which are *isolated*.
By design a container will only use a single core (the lowest numbered core) when multiple isolated cores are selected.<br>
Usually this is not what a user wants when selecting multiple cores.
:end

:cpu_isolation_help:
CPU isolation allows the user to specify CPU cores that are to be explicitly reserved for assignment (to VMs or Docker containers).

This is incredibly important for gaming VMs to run smoothly because even if you manually pin your Docker containers to not overlap with your gaming VM,
the host OS can still utilize those same cores as the guest VM needs for things like returning responses for the webGui, running a parity check, btrfs operations, etc.

Determines how the webGUI responds to HTTP and/or HTTPS protocol.

Select **No** to disable HTTPS

Select **Yes** to enable HTTPS and redirect HTTP to HTTPS. If a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate has not
been provisioned, then an automatically generated self-signed SSL certificate will be used.

Select **Auto** if you are using or plan to use a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate provisioned
by Lime Technology. Before the certificate is provisioned, the webGUI remains
in http-mode. After provisioning, the webGUI automatically switches to https-mode. In addition
two background processes are enabled:

- *updatedns* - This starts 30 seconds after server reboot has completed and contacts the Lime Technology
DNS service to register the servers local IP address. Thereafter it wakes up every 10 minutes in case
the local IP address has changed again.

- *renewcert* - This starts 60 seconds after server reboot has completed and contacts the Lime Technology
certificate renewal service to determine if your Let's Encrypt SSL certificate needs to be renewed.
Thereafter it wakes up every 24 hours. If within 30 days of expiration, a new certificate is automatically
provisioned and downloaded to your server.

Note: After provisioning a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate you may turn off the *updatedns* and *newcert*
background processes by changing this field to **Yes**.

**nginx certificate handling details**

The nginx startup script looks for a SSL certificate on the USB boot flash in this order:<br>
`config/ssl/certs/certificate_bundle.pem`<br>
`config/ssl/certs/<server-name>_unraid_bundle.pem`

If neither file exists, a self-signed SSL certificate is automatically created and stored in<br>
`config/ssl/certs/<server-name>_unraid_bundle.pem`<br>

Provisioning a Let's Encrypt certificate writes the certificate to<br>
`config/ssl/certs/certificate_bundle.pem`<br>

**nginx stapling support**

Whether nginx enables OCSP Staping is determined by which certificate is in use:<br>
`config/ssl/certs/certificate_bundle.pem` => Yes<br>
`config/ssl/certs/<server-name>_unraid_bundle.pem` => No

:mgmt_certificate_expiration_help:
**Provision** may be used to allocate a *free* SSL Certficiate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and
then upload to your server. Note: We **highly** recommend using a static IP address in this case.

**Update DNS** may be used to manually initiate updating the DNS A-record of your server FQDN on unraid.net. Note
that DNS propagation change could take anywhere from 1 minute to several hours (we set TTL to 60 seconds).

Note: **Provision** may fail if your router or upstream DNS server has
[DNS rebinding protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding) enabled. DNS rebinding
protection prevents DNS from resolving a private IP network range. DNS rebinding protection is meant as
a security feature on a local LAN which includes legacy devices with buggy/insecure "web" interfaces.

One source of DNS rebinding protection could be your ISP DNS server. In this case the problem may be solved by
switching to a different DNS server such as Google's public DNS.

More commonly, DNS rebinding protection could be enabled in your router. Most consumer routers do not implement DNS
rebinding protection; but, if they do, a configuration setting should be available to turn it off.

Higher end routers usually do enable DNS rebinding protection however. Typically there are ways of turning it off
entirely or selectively based on domain. Examples:

**DD-WRT:** If you are using "dnsmasq" with DNS rebinding protection enabled, you can add this line to your router
configuration file:

`rebind-domain-ok=/unraid.net/`

**pfSense:** If you are using pfSense internal DNS resolver service, you can add these Custom Option lines:

`server:`<br>
`private-domain: "unraid.net"`

**Ubiquiti USG router:** you can add this configuration line:

`set service dns forwarding options rebind-domain-ok=/unraid.net/`

**OpenDNS:** Go to Settings -> Security and *remove* the checkbox next to
 "Suspicious Responses - Block internal IP addresses". It is an all-or-nothing setting.

When all else fails, you can create an entry in your PC's *hosts* file to override external DNS and
directly resolve your servers unraid.net FQDN to its local IP address.

:nfs_enable_help:
Select 'Yes' to enable the NFS protocol.
:end

:nfs_tunable_fuse_remember_help:
When NFS is enabled, this Tunable may be used to alleviate or solve instances of "NFS Stale File Handles"
you might encounter with your NFS client.

In essence, (fuse_remember) tells an internal subsystem (named "fuse") how long to "remember" or "cache"
file and directory information associated with user shares.  When an NFS client attempts to access a file
(or directory) on the server, and that file (or directory) name is not cached, then you could encounter
"stale file handle".

The numeric value of this tunable is the number of seconds to cache file/directory name entries,
where the default value of 330 indicates 5 1/2 minutes.  There are two special values you may also set
this to:

* 0 which means, do not cache file/directory names at all, and
* -1 which means cache file/directory names forever (or until array is stopped)

A value of 0 would be appropriate if you are enabling NFS but only plan to use it for disk shares,
not user shares.

A value of -1 would be appropriate if no other timeout seems to solve the "stale file handle" on
your client.  Be aware that setting a value of -1 will cause the memory footprint to grow by approximately
108 bytes per file/directory name cached.  Depending how much RAM is installed in your server and how many
files/directories you access via NFS this may or may not lead to out-of-memory conditions.
:end

:shares_enable_disk_help:
If set to No, disk shares are unconditionally not exported.

If set to Yes, disk shares may be exported.  **WARNING:** Do not copy data from a disk share to a user share

:end

:eth_enable_bonding_help:
Bonding is a feature that combines multiple physical Ethernet interfaces into a single *bonded* interface named **bond0**.
This can be used to improve the connection redundancy and/or throughput of the system.
Different bonding modes are supported (see below), but some modes require proper switch support.
:end

:eth_bonding_mode_help:
**Mode 0 (balance-rr)**<br>
This mode transmits packets in a sequential order from the first available slave through the last.
If two real interfaces are slaves in the bond and two packets arrive destined out of the bonded interface the first will be transmitted on the first slave and the second frame will be transmitted on the second slave.
The third packet will be sent on the first and so on. This provides load balancing and fault tolerance.

**Mode 1 (active-backup) - default**<br>
This mode places one of the interfaces into a backup state and will only make it active if the link is lost by the active interface.
Only one slave in the bond is active at an instance of time. A different slave becomes active only when the active slave fails.
This mode provides fault tolerance.

**Mode 2 (balance-xor)**<br>
This mode transmits packets based on an XOR formula. Source MAC address is XOR'd with destination MAC address modula slave count.
This selects the same slave for each destination MAC address and provides load balancing and fault tolerance.

**Mode 3 (broadcast)**<br>
This mode transmits everything on all slave interfaces. This mode is least used (only for specific purpose) and provides only fault tolerance.

**Mode 4 (802.3ad)**<br>
This mode is known as *Dynamic Link Aggregation*. It creates aggregation groups that share the same speed and duplex settings.
It requires a switch that supports IEEE 802.3ad dynamic link.
Slave selection for outgoing traffic is done according to the transmit hash policy, which may be changed from the default simple XOR policy via the xmit_hash_policy option.
Note that not all transmit policies may be 802.3ad compliant, particularly inregards to the packet mis-ordering requirements of section 43.2.4 of the 802.3ad standard.
Different peer implementations will have varying tolerances for noncompliance.

**Mode 5 (balance-tlb)**<br>
This mode is called *Adaptive transmit load balancing*. The outgoing traffic is distributed according to the current load and queue on each slave interface.
Incoming traffic is received by the current slave.

**Mode 6 (balance-alb)**<br>
This mode is called *Adaptive load balancing*. This includes balance-tlb + receive load balancing (rlb) for IPV4 traffic.
The receive load balancing is achieved by ARP negotiation.
The bonding driver intercepts the ARP Replies sent by the server on their way out and overwrites the src hw address with the unique hw address of one of the slaves in the bond
such that different clients use different hw addresses for the server.

*Mode 1 (active-backup) is the recommended setting. Other modes allow you to set up a specific environment, but may require proper switch support.
Choosing a unsupported mode can result in a disrupted communication.*
:end

:eth_bonding_members_help:

:apc_runtime_left_help:
If during a power failure, the remaining runtime in minutes (as calculated internally by the UPS) is below or equal to this field, apcupsd, will initiate a system shutdown.
:end

:apc_battery_time_help:
If during a power failure, the UPS has run on batteries for *time-out* many seconds or longer; apcupsd will initiate a system shutdown. A value of zero disables this timer.

If you have a Smart UPS, you will most likely want to disable this timer by setting it to zero.
That way, your UPS will continue on batteries until either the % charge remaining drops to or below *Battery level* or the remaining battery runtime drops to or below *minutes*.

Of course - when testing - setting this to 60 causes a quick system shutdown if you pull the power plug.
If you have an older dumb UPS, you will want to set this to less than the time you know you can run on batteries.
:end

:apc_note_help:
**Note:** *Battery level*, *Runtime left*, and *Time on battery* work in conjunction, so the first that occurs will cause the initiation of a shutdown.

检查一个或多个 CPU 内核将限制该容器仅在选定的内核上运行。 如果不选择核心，容器将在所有可用核心上运行（默认）
:end

:docker_fixed_ip_help:
如果选择网桥类型，应用程序的网络访问将被限制为仅在端口映射部分中指定的端口上进行通信。
如果选择主机类型，将为应用程序提供访问权限，使其可以使用主机上尚未映射到另一个正在使用的应用程序 / 服务的任何端口进行通信。
一般来说，建议将此设置保留为每个应用程序模板指定的默认值。

重要说明：如果要调整端口映射，请不要修改容器端口的设置，因为只能调整主机端口。
:end

:docker_privileged_help:
对于需要直接使用主机设备访问权限或需要充分利用主机功能的容器，将需要选择此选项。

:sysdevs_iommu_groups_help:
此将显示系统上可用的IOMMU组的列表，以及每个IOMMU组的lspci命令的输出。 数字标识符用于配置PCI直通。

您选择的设备将在引导时绑定到vfio-pci驱动程序，这使它们可用于分配给虚拟机，并且还防止Linux内核自动将它们绑定到任何现有的主机驱动程序。

**请注意，选择设备不仅会绑定指定的设备，而且还会绑定同一 IOMMU 组中的*所有*其他设备。**

&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-circle orb green-orb middle"></i>&nbsp;此符号表示设备当前已绑定到 vfio-pci 驱动程序。

&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-retweet grey-orb middle"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 此符号表示设备支持 FLR （功能级别重置）。

<input type="checkbox" value="" disabled>&nbsp;&nbsp; 如果复选框为灰色，则表示该设备已被Unraid使用，无法直通。
